Palm::ListDB::Writer
====================

Palm::ListDB::Writer is a module that easily constructs databases for
the Palm utility List. List is written by Andrew Low (roo@magma.ca,
http://www.magma.ca/~roo).

An utility program csv2lsdb is included that can generate List DBs
from comma-separated value files (CSVs).

See http://www.magma.ca/~roo for more information on the List utility.

This module is not based on L<Palm::PDB> or L<Palm::ListDB>.

Advantages of Palm::ListDB::Writer over Palm::ListDB:

 * Easy to use
 * Automatic maintenance of categories, adding them on the fly if you want
 * Controlled flexibility in truncating data that is too long
 * Presorts the database records

Advantages of Palm::ListDB over Palm::ListDB::Writer:

 * Based on Palm::PDB, hence gives more detailed control over the database
 * Can import databases as well
